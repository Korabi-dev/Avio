# this.db

A cache based management tool, for saving variables on the current process.

```js
const db = require("this.db");
db.saveData("test", "value"); //This would save the key "test" to the ":cache:" server.
db.saveData("test", "value 2", "server-test"); //This would save the key "test" to the "server-test" server.
db.getData("test"); //Would log "value"
db.getData("test", "server-test"); //Would log "value2"
```

This could be useful if you need to store data from callbacks, different files or functions.
I hope this helps :D
